	<p>"Nothing is too wonderful to be true, if it be consistent with the laws of nature." - <em>Michael Faraday</em></p>
		<p><em>Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas</br>
		Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;</br>
		Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,</br>
		And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;</br>
		Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,</br>
		Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,</br>
		To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,</br>
		Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,</br>
		Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;</br>
