		Earth's increase, foison plenty, </br>
		Barns and garners never empty, </br>
		Vines and clustering bunches growing, </br>
		Plants with goodly burthen bowing; </br>
		Spring come to you at the farthest </br>
		In the very end of harvest! </br>
		Scarcity and want shall shun you; </br>
		Ceres' blessing so is on you. </br>
